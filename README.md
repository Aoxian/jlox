# jlox
An implementation of the Lox programing language, from the book [Crafting Interprets](https://craftinginterpreters.com) by Bob Nystrom.
* This version of jlox is a tree-walk interpreter, written test first.

## Setup
- For this implementation of jlox, we are using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) for project management tasks.

## Run
- With no argument, the program will act at a Lox REPL.
- With one argument, a path to a file, the program will interpret the file.
